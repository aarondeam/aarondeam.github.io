      <h3>Letter from Dirk</h3>
      <p>Hello everyone,</p>
      <p>Thank you all for your kind messages of support and for your willingness to share ideas and insights about the prospects of a congressional campaign.  I particularly want to thank all of you who have volunteered to help in various ways.  Those of you who know me from my courses know that “making publics” involves a commitment to public action, a commitment that builds on the power of individuals acting together in matters that affect us all.  In that respect, your hundreds of heartfelt responses over the last few weeks show that an enthusiastic and powerful public has come into being.  That is exciting news.</p>
      <p>I want to tell you why I have come to consider a run for Congress.  The 2016 election surely caught us all by surprise, but the forces behind that moment have been acting on the nation for a long time.  Our political culture is badly factionalized and polarized.  We rely too much on mass media that paint in broad strokes.  We rely too little on face-to-face interactions that respect individuals and build communities.  We too often dismiss, with almost habitual disdain, the possibilities of government.  These familiar problems have brought us to a moment of crisis.  Everyone senses it.  And now, many of us find ourselves drawn to action to help bring about changes that we know are long overdue.</p>
      <p>I want to improve the way we do our politics.  We can act better than we have been as citizens of our state and our nation.  All of us can.  We can be more faithful to the possibilities of representative government, the most important path our Founders left us for finding the common good.  We can be more tolerant and respectful toward each other and work to focus on the needs of people instead of parties.  We can look for ways to value the differences we each bring to the republic we all constitute, and to connect across those differences rather than to divide.   And we can remember, as history teaches us, that when we act together in all our differences, truly amazing things are possible.  I want to work toward reviving that sense of public spirit.</p>
      <p>Iowa has a long history of experience in face-to-face politics.  Our caucuses bring us together with our neighbors to talk and make choices that affect the whole country.  Presidents, whose political reach eventually spans the globe, first come here, to Iowa, to chat with us in coffee shops, schools, and family rooms.  So this is the perfect place and time to begin changing our politics in a way that refocuses on the power of individuals working together to address their common needs and their common hopes.  I hope you will continue to act with us in pursuing this challenge.</p>
      <p>- Dirk </p>

      <h3>Something Better</h3>
      <p>First, I want to thank my fellow Story County Democrats for inviting me this evening, for letting me meet all of you and hear this evening’s speakers, and for giving me this chance to introduce myself.  </p>
      <p>I thought that if there were anything I could add to the many insights and appeals we have all heard this evening, it might be to convey what one learns trying to teach young people about politics year after year.  I do not pretend to speak for young people or to lump them into any simple category.  They are fully able to speak for themselves.  But the questions many of them ask and the assumptions many of them make reveal some interesting things. </p>
      <p>One of these is how anxious they are for change.  Another is how skeptical so many are that change can come from political parties. For those here tonight who believe with me in the vision and possibilities of the Democratic Party, who know its rich history as an engine of innovation rooted in compassion and connection, this means we have some work to do.</p>
      <p>Yet when it comes to matters of principle and vision, whether they call themselves “liberal,” or “conservative,” or “independent,” the young people I talk to have much in common with us all.  </p>
      <p>Even at their young age, they are already tired of watching candidates come and go, while our divisions only grow wider and our progress ever more fragile.  They want something better, and so do we all.  </p>
      <p>They are tired of seeing our politics bound to money and salesmanship, while the obvious needs of the world around us remain ignored.  They want something better, and so do we all. </p>
      <p>They are tired of the oldest of stories, where the greedy gather ever more to themselves at the expense of common concerns.  They are tired of having to settle for public government hobbled by the corruption of self-interest.  They want something better, and so do we all.</p>
      <p>They are tired of seeing groups who speak out in the best American traditions of public dissent mocked and demonized, while appeals to undeniable principles of justice go unheeded.  They want something better, and so do we all.</p>
      <p>They are tired of the exploitation of hatred and division and obstruction as substitutes for government.  They are tired of seeing complex issues reduced to partisan meanness.  They want something better, and so do we all.</p>
      <p>They are tired of all the lying.  They want politics built on truth, and so do we all.</p>
      <p>Like many people across the country, young people have been stirred to action amid alarming changes in our nation that clash with their hopes for a better world.  But they have been taught by a particularly brutal lesson from the last election that activism and even voting do not guarantee the outcomes they wish to see.  Enduring political change comes not merely from being for or against something.   It comes from a commitment to acting with others, finding by our personal interactions what is truly in the common interest.  As it happens, this is exactly what I find young people to be most drawn to:  not an emphasis on division, but a deeply and inspiringly moral commitment to what is good for all. </p>
      <p>So what to do?</p>
      <p>Well, we can protest. Public protest, reminding everyone of what is just, of what serves the public good, is essential when those principles are threatened.  Protest is as American as the Revolution:  progressive in seeking change; conservative in binding us to cherished principles.  But protesting alone does not win elections.  Protesting does not work out the compromises or deliberate the public policies that turn principles into governing.  </p>
      <p>To accomplish those things, to bring what we want into enduring practice, ultimately requires interaction among us all:  listening as much as speaking out; paying attention to our neighbors in their lives; offering service to the noble cause of finding what needs and hopes we share and empowering each other toward those aims; in short, acting on the democratic commitment to the people from which our party draws its name. </p>
      <p>It is tempting, in moments of anger and urgency, to insist on particular priorities and positions.  But think for a second about why so many Iowans are angry these past few weeks.  The party in charge has put ideology ahead of the people, insisting on imposing a national party agenda, without regard for locality or condition or need, and whose only measure of success is conformity.  There is more to Iowa than rigid partisanship, and we all know it.</p>
      <p>A teacher sees a student struggling with a lesson.  She does not ask whether he is liberal or conservative.  She finds a way to help him learn.  A farmer suddenly falls ill and cannot complete the harvest.  His neighbors do not ask who he voted for in the last election.  They come and lend their work and see the task through. You see a family whose car has slid off the road.  You don’t ask what political party they belong to.  You check to see whether they are safe, and then you get together and you push.</p>
      <p>Iowa has a long history of experience in local, face-to-face politics that builds power from the plurality and connection of our people.  Our caucuses bring us together with our neighbors to talk and make choices that affect the whole country.  Presidents, whose political reach eventually spans the globe, first come here, to Iowa, to chat with us in our coffee shops and our schools and our family rooms. So this is the perfect place and time to focus anew on the power of Americans working together, in all our differences, to address our common needs and our common hopes.  I hope you will join and act with us as we pursue the promise of that opportunity.</p>

      <h3>Why I Am Running for Congress</h3>

      <h4>Address for the Boone County Soup Supper, 2/24/2017 (as delivered)</h4>
      <p>Hello everyone.  I am Dirk Deam from Ames, Iowa.  I am considering a run for Congress in this, the Fourth District of Iowa.
      </p>
      <p>I want to thank my fellow Democrats here in Boone for inviting me this evening, for letting me meet all of you and hear Rob and Todd speak, and for giving me this chance to introduce myself.  
      </p>
      <p>I was born and raised in northeastern Kansas. My wife Annie and I have lived in Iowa for 24 years, and we raised our three children here. We are both teachers. 
      </p>
      <p>Now, on a matter that I know is crucial to Iowans in the 4th District, I can tell you that I did in fact attend the University of Iowa for my PhD.  (I guess that means I’m a “Hawkeye”…)  On the other hand, I teach at Iowa State.  (I guess that makes me a “Cyclone”).  So there’s a little something for everyone here. (Actually, truth be told, by my undergraduate degree, I’m a “Jayhawk.”   Hey, congratulations, Cyclones on beating those Jayhawks in Allen Field House a couple weeks ago!  How’s that for political pandering?).  
      </p>
      <p>I joined the Political Science department at Iowa State 17 years ago, and I have had the good fortune to able to teach across a wide variety of subjects in American politics, law, technology policy, environmental policy, and political theory.  If I specialize in anything it would be in drawing attention to the way the American founders believed healthy politics to be the basic working ingredient of our constitutional system.
      </p>
      <p>Before moving to Iowa and teaching politics, I worked in the nation’s space program for many years as an aerospace engineer. I worked on the Space Shuttle in California and later managed what was called “flight design” for the Rockwell Shuttle Operation Company in Houston, coordinating the various engineering teams who planned Shuttle missions and payloads. 
      </p>
      <p>I am also a lawyer.  Like a lot of my law professors, I teach my classes in a way that draws people out so that they interact with each other on tough questions.  It makes them think about what they say.  And it makes pay attention to those around them.  I think of that as a form of political practice.  So I teach politics by getting my students to do politics.  My speciality in teaching law centers on the U.S. Constitution, and one way or another that works its way into all the classes and lessons I teach.
      </p>
      <p>I want to tell you why I have come to consider a run for Congress.  The 2016 election surely caught us all by surprise, but the forces behind that moment have been acting on the nation for a long time.  Our political culture is badly factionalized and polarized.  We rely too much on mass media that paint in broad strokes.  We rely too little on the face-to-face interactions that respect individuals and build communities.  We too often dismiss, almost habitually now, the possibilities of government at a time when our public problems are as vital and challenging as they have ever been.  These familiar failings have brought us to a moment of crisis.  Everyone senses it.  And now, many of us find ourselves drawn to action to help bring about changes that we know are long overdue.
      </p>
      <p>What I have done for years teaching college students I want to do now as a candidate:  I want to try to help improve the way we do our politics.  We can act with more attentive regard to our role as citizens of our state and our nation.  All of us can.  We can be more faithful to the possibilities of representative government, the most important path our Founders left us for finding common good.  We can be more tolerant and respectful toward each other, working to connect instead of divide.  We can revitalize our political parties as opportunities for civic interaction, instead of merely devices for winning elections.  We can look for ways to value the unique perspectives each of us brings to the republic that we all constitute, and to regard those differences not as a source of discord but as an enlargement of public possibilities.   And we can remember, as history teaches us, that when we act together in all our differences, truly amazing things are possible.  I want to work toward reviving that sense of public spirit.
      </p>
      <p>After 17 years of teaching politics, of urging young people to take politics and citizenship seriously, I am optimistic that we can succeed.  I have found that people are drawn to the possibilities of politics when, instead of merely talking at them about public matters, you invite them to participate and interact in the discussions about things that matter to us all.  That kind of interaction takes time and practice and patience to develop.  But I’ve seen that when given the opportunity to engage each other in common concerns, people find ways to transcend their differences, and they enjoy feeling a part of something bigger than themselves. That’s very hopeful in any case, but especially so when you see it in young people.  They are what we can see of the future.    
      </p>
      <p>Iowa has a long history of experience in face-to-face politics.  Our caucuses bring us together with our neighbors to talk and make choices that affect the whole country.  Presidents, whose political reach eventually spans the globe, first come here, to Iowa, to chat with us in our coffee shops and our schools and our family rooms.  So this is the perfect place and time to begin changing our politics in a way that refocuses on the power of individuals working together to address their common needs and their common hopes.  I hope you will join and act with us as we pursue this challenge.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you.
